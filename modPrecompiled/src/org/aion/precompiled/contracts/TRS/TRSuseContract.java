/**
 * The TRSuseContract is 1 of 3 inter-dependent but separate contracts that together make up the
 * public-facing TRS contract. A public-facing TRS contract can be owned by any user. In addition to
 * a regular user being able to own a public-facing TRS contract, there is also a special instance
 * of the public-facing TRS contract that is owned by The Aion Foundation itself, which differs from
 * the private TRS contract.
 *
 * The public-facing TRS contract was split into 3 contracts mostly for user-friendliness, since the
 * TRS contract supports many operations, rather than have a single execute method and one very
 * large document specifying its use, the contract was split into 3 logical components instead.
 *
 * The TRSuseContract is the component of the public-facing TRS contract that users of the contract
 * (as well as the owner) interact with in order to perform some state-changing operation on the
 * contract itself. Some of the supported operations are privileged and can only be called by the
 * contract owner.
 *
 * The following operations are supported:
 *      deposit -- deposits funds into a public-facing TRS contract.
 *      withdraw -- withdraws funds from a public-facing TRS contract.
 *      bulkDepositFor -- bulk fund depositing on the behalf of depositors. Owner-only.
 *      bulkWithdraw -- bulk fund withdrawal to all depositors. Owner-only.
 *      refund -- refunds funds to a depositor. Can only be called prior to locking. Owner-only.
 *      depositFor -- deposits funds into a public-facing TRS contract on an accout's behalf. Owner-only.
 *      addExtraFunds -- adds extra funds to contract, in case of subsequent sales. Owner-only.

     *   where:

     *
     *     conditions: the calling account must have enough balance to deposit amount otherwise this
     *       method effectively does nothing. The deposit operation is enabled only when the contract
     *       is unlocked; once locked depositing is disabled. If a contract has its funds open then
     *       this operation is disabled.

     *     period as well as a special one-off withdrawal that will be claimed automatically on the
     *     account's first ever withdrawal. If an account has missed previous periods then the next
     *     call to this operation will withdraw for the current period as well as any previously
     *     missed periods.
     *
     *     In the special case that a contract has its funds open, the first call to this operation
     *     after the funds are opened will withdraw all funds that the contract owes the caller
     *     including bonus. Any subsequent calls will fail.

     *     other accounts. This is a convenience operation for the owner to use the depositFor logic
     *     in bulk. This operation supports depositing into the contract on behalf of up to 100
     *     accounts.
     *
     *     Define "entry" as the following 160b array: [<32b - accountAddress> | <128b - amount>]
     *     Then the arguments to this operation are:
     *       32-byte contractAddress followed by a contiguous list of X 160-byte entry arrays,

     *       attempting to deposit funds into.

     *       accountAddress is the address of an account the caller is attempting to deposit funds
     *       into the contract for.
     *       amount is the corresponding amount of funds to deposit on behalf of accountAddress.
     *
     *     conditions: the TRS contract must not yet be locked (nor obviously live) to bulkDeposit

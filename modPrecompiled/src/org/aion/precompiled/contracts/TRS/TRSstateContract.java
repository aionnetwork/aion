/**
 * The TRSstateContract is 1 of 3 inter-dependent but separate contracts that together make up the
 * public-facing TRS contract. A public-facing TRS contract can be owned by any user. In addition to
 * a regular user being able to own a public-facing TRS contract, there is also a special instance
 * of the public-facing TRS contract that is owned by The Aion Foundation itself, which differs from
 * the private TRS contract.
 *
 * The public-facing TRS contract was split into 3 contracts mostly for user-friendliness, since the
 * TRS contract supports many operations, rather than have a single execute method and one very
 * large document specifying its use, the contract was split into 3 logical components instead.
 *
 * The TRSstateContract is the component of the public-facing TRS contract that the contract owner
 * interacts with primarily. The operations provided here are all operations that only the contract
 * owner can use and are related to the overall integrity of the contract itself.
 *
 * The following operations are supported:
 *      create -- creates a new public TRS contract.
 *      lock -- locks the TRS contract so that no more deposits may be made.
 *      start -- starts the distribution of the savings in the TRS contract.
 *      openFunds -- kills the TRS contract and unlocks all of the funds for depositors to withdraw.

/**
 * The TRSqueryContract is 1 of 3 inter-dependent but separate contracts that together make up the
 * public-facing TRS contract. A public-facing TRS contract can be owned by any user. In addition to
 * a regular user being able to own a public-facing TRS contract, there is also a special instance
 * of the public-facing TRS contract that is owned by The Aion Foundation itself, which differs from
 * the private TRS contract.
 *
 * The public-facing TRS contract was split into 3 contracts mostly for user-friendliness, since the
 * TRS contract supports many operations, rather than have a single execute method and one very
 * large document specifying its use, the contract was split into 3 logical components instead.
 *
 * The TRSqueryContract is the component of the public-facing TRS contract that users of the contract
 * (as well as the owner) interact with in order to make simple queries on the contract. None of the
 * operations supported here will change the state of the contract. This contract extends
 * StatefulPrecompiledContract not because it changes state but only for database access.
 *
 * The following operations are supported:
 *      isStarted -- checks whether a TRS contract is live.
 *      isLocked -- checks whether a TRS contract is locked.
 *      isDirectDeposit -- checks whether a depositor can directly deposit to a TRS contract or not.
 *      period -- checks the current period that a TRS contract is in.
 *      periodAt -- checks the period that a TRS contract is in at a specific block.
 *      availableForWithdrawalAt -- checks the fraction of total withdrawable funds for a contract.
